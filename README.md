# Whispered-Pages-3
An innovative ebook platform leveraging AI and personalized recordings to transform text into engaging audiobooks. Intended for busy parents seeking quality reading time with their children and individuals with learning disabilities.

# Purpose
WhisperedPages is a digital platform hosting a curated collection of children's books. Guardians can record their own voice narrations for the stories, fostering closer connections with their children one book at a time. In a time where distance and life commitments separate us from loved ones, our platform aims to bridge gaps through the magic of storytelling. Additionally, text-to-speech options ensure accessibility for all children.

As first and second generation immigrant children, one aspect of this project that is very important to us is its potential role in preserving our native languages. Growing up without a surrounding community, our parents were our only link to our languages, cultural heritage, and traditions. We hope that by bridging this gap between parents and children, this platform can also be leveraged for families who speak less common languages to preserve that connection and strengthen ties to their cultural identity.

# Project Ethics
As a website that aims to provide children a safe and enriching environment online, we prioritize the importance of maintaining strict ethical means to ensure our website upholds our values. As children-focused digital environments continue to decline, we specifically aim to prioritize the importance of accessible education and fostering personal relationships for children.

We carefully curate the books on WhisperedPages to be appropriate for child audiences which promote values such as kindness, empathy, and selflessness. We require consent from adult users for our app to store personal data, such as voice recordings, on our website. Personal data will always be available for users to access in order to manage or delete recordings to ensure their childrenâ€™s safety. Text-to-Speech is another alternative for our books to account for different learning preferences, disabilities, and to encourage children to continue reading in the case their guardian is not able to record. 

Our hand-picked books are strictly on the public domain and/or have no copyright to ensure our respect toward private domains and do not violate property rights.

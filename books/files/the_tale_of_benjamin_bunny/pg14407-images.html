<hr class="short">
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/08.jpg" id="id-1031362464558691361"><img alt="On the bank" src="images/08-tb.jpg" title="On the bank" id="id-4705806136759526708"></a></p>
<p>One morning a little rabbit sat on a bank.</p>
<p>He pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony.</p>
<p>A gig was coming along the road; it was driven by Mr. McGregor, and beside
him sat Mrs. McGregor in her best bonnet.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/11.jpg" id="id-8559598935188515888"><img alt="Hop, skip" src="images/11-tb.jpg" title="Hop, skip" id="id-1242852220049601307"></a></p>
<p><br>As soon as they had passed, little Benjamin Bunny slid down into the road,
and set off—with a hop, skip, and a jump—to call upon his relations, who
lived in the wood at the back of Mr. McGregor's garden.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/12.jpg" id="id-2680803563101218905"><img alt="The Hole" src="images/12-tb.jpg" title="The Hole" id="id-7976614938742629687"></a></p>
<p><br>That wood was full of rabbit holes; and in the neatest, sandiest hole of
all lived Benjamin's aunt and his cousins—Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and
Peter.</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Rabbit was a widow; she earned her living by knitting rabbit-wool
mittens and muffatees (I once bought a pair at a bazaar). She also sold
herbs, and rosemary tea, and rabbit-tobacco (which is what we call
lavender).</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/15.jpg" id="id-10283139382195248"><img alt="Ears" src="images/15-tb.jpg" title="Ears" id="id-72372126666597861"></a></p>
<p><br>Little Benjamin did not very much want to see his Aunt.</p>
<p>He came round the back of the fir-tree, and nearly tumbled upon the top of
his Cousin Peter.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/16.jpg" id="id-969646174762085543"><img alt="In a handkerchief" src="images/16-tb.jpg" title="In a Handkerchief" id="id-809803081148036334"></a></p>
<p><br>Peter was sitting by himself. He looked poorly, and was dressed in a red
cotton pocket-handkerchief.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/19.jpg" id="id-6126872258540910943"><img alt="The Whisper" src="images/19-tb.jpg" title="The Whisper" id="id-7661442154797997089"></a></p>
<p>"Peter," said little Benjamin, in a whisper, "who has got your clothes?"</p>
<p>Peter replied, "The scarecrow in Mr. McGregor's garden," and described how
he had been chased about the garden, and had dropped his shoes and coat.</p>
<p>Little Benjamin sat down beside his cousin and assured him that Mr.
McGregor had gone out in a gig, and Mrs. McGregor also; and certainly for
the day, because she was wearing her best bonnet.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/20.jpg" id="id-5592768958994556659"><img alt="Led away" src="images/20-tb.jpg" title="Led away" id="id-7828293709637230354"></a></p>
<p><br>Peter said he hoped that it would rain.</p>
<p>At this point old Mrs. Rabbit's voice was heard inside the rabbit hole,
calling: "Cotton-tail! Cotton-tail! fetch some more camomile!"</p>
<p>Peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/23.jpg" id="id-1862127821993635657"><img alt="Looking Down on the Garden" src="images/23-tb.jpg" title="Looking Down on the Garden" id="id-3724873249760314347"></a></p>
<p><br>They went away hand in hand, and got upon the flat top of the wall at the
bottom of the wood. From here they looked down into Mr. McGregor's garden.
Peter's coat and shoes were plainly to be seen upon the scarecrow, topped
with an old tam-o'-shanter of Mr. McGregor's.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/24.jpg" id="id-299173322093276304"><img alt="Falling" src="images/24-tb.jpg" title="Falling" id="id-8815981701428735377"></a></p>
<p><br>Little Benjamin said: "It spoils people's clothes to squeeze under a gate;
the proper way to get in is to climb down a pear-tree."</p>
<p>Peter fell down head first; but it was of no consequence, as the bed below
was newly raked and quite soft.</p>
<p>It had been sown with lettuces.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/27.jpg" id="id-789187284043025491"><img alt="Footmarks" src="images/27-tb.jpg" title="Footmarks" id="id-6681785685123414151"></a></p>
<p><br>They left a great many odd little footmarks all over the bed, especially
little Benjamin, who was wearing clogs.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/28.jpg" id="id-792100553025539871"><img alt="Tam" src="images/28-tb.jpg" title="Tam" id="id-818221360987746932"></a></p>
<p><br>Little Benjamin said that the first thing to be done was to get back
Peter's clothes, in order that they might be able to use the
pocket-handkerchief.</p>
<p>They took them off the scarecrow. There had been rain during the night;
there was water in the shoes, and the coat was somewhat shrunk.</p>
<p>Benjamin tried on the tam-o'-shanter, but it was too big for him.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/31.jpg" id="id-2456949098053336695"><img alt="Filling the pockets" src="images/31-tb.jpg" title="Filling the Pockets" id="id-7031141374789140929"></a></p>
<p><br>Then he suggested that they should fill the pocket-handkerchief with
onions, as a little present for his Aunt.</p>
<p>Peter did not seem to be enjoying himself; he kept hearing noises.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/32.jpg" id="id-3144660562564419062"><img alt="Munching lettuce" src="images/32-tb.jpg" title="Munching Lettuce" id="id-7396054927166023312"></a></p>
<p><br>Benjamin, on the contrary, was perfectly at home, and ate a lettuce leaf.
He said that he was in the habit of coming to the garden with his father
to get lettuces for their Sunday dinner.</p>
<p>(The name of little Benjamin's papa was old Mr. Benjamin Bunny.)</p>
<p>The lettuces certainly were very fine.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/35.jpg" id="id-6734494723473862936"><img alt="Dropping Onions" src="images/35-tb.jpg" title="Dropping Onions" id="id-6422832797732008673"></a></p>
<p><br>Peter did not eat anything; he said he should like to go home. Presently
he dropped half the onions.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/36.jpg" id="id-996779621258558359"><img alt="He boldly led the way" src="images/36-tb.jpg" title="He boldly led the way" id="id-4139667431089193604"></a></p>
<p><br>Little Benjamin said that it was not possible to get back up the pear-tree
with a load of vegetables. He led the way boldly towards the other end of
the garden. They went along a little walk on planks, under a sunny, red
brick wall.</p>
<p>The mice sat on their doorsteps cracking cherry-stones; they winked at
Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin Bunny.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/39.jpg" id="id-1109436700487414451"><img alt="Dropped Again" src="images/39-tb.jpg" title="Dropped Again" id="id-8048301585315514222"></a></p>
<p><br>Presently Peter let the pocket-handkerchief go again.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/40.jpg" id="id-2225191332105191461"><img alt="Hearing Noises" src="images/40-tb.jpg" title="Hearing Noises" id="id-6008284748856938070"></a></p>
<p><br>They got amongst flower-pots, and frames, and tubs. Peter heard noises
worse than ever; his eyes were as big as lolly-pops!</p>
<p>He was a step or two in front of his cousin when he suddenly stopped.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/43.jpg" id="id-1035737317961262624"><img alt="Cat" src="images/43-tb.jpg" title="Cat" id="id-250396408136663549"></a></p>
<p><br>This is what those little rabbits saw round that corner!</p>
<p>Little Benjamin took one look, and then, in half a minute less than no
time, he hid himself and Peter and the onions underneath a large
basket....</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/44.jpg" id="id-818680566730523526"><img alt="Cat Sniffing Basket" src="images/44-tb.jpg" title="Cat Sniffing Basket" id="id-1410528954968565700"></a></p>
<p><br>The cat got up and stretched herself, and came and sniffed at the basket.</p>
<p>Perhaps she liked the smell of onions!</p>
<p>Anyway, she sat down upon the top of the basket.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/47.jpg" id="id-2111856661871776962"><img alt="Cat on Basket" src="images/47-tb.jpg" title="Cat on Basket" id="id-4207247436718778184"></a></p>
<p><br>She sat there for <i>five hours</i>.</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;">
<p>I cannot draw you a picture of Peter and Benjamin underneath the basket,
because it was quite dark, and because the smell of onions was fearful; it
made Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin cry.</p>
<p>The sun got round behind the wood, and it was quite late in the afternoon;
but still the cat sat upon the basket.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/48.jpg" id="id-148694118513604977"><img alt="Benjamin" src="images/48-tb.jpg" title="Benjamin" id="id-3661784940520576816"></a></p>
<p><br>At length there was a pitter-patter, pitter-patter, and some bits of
mortar fell from the wall above.</p>
<p>The cat looked up and saw old Mr. Benjamin Bunny prancing along the top of
the wall of the upper terrace.</p>
<p>He was smoking a pipe of rabbit-tobacco, and had a little switch in his
hand.</p>
<p>He was looking for his son.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/51.jpg" id="id-2210620683917008598"><img alt="Benjamin Pounces" src="images/51-tb.jpg" title="Benjamin Pounces" id="id-6981694775635946123"></a></p>
<p><br>Old Mr. Bunny had no opinion whatever of cats.</p>
<p>He took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the
cat, and cuffed it off the basket, and kicked it into the greenhouse,
scratching off a handful of fur.</p>
<p>The cat was too much surprised to scratch back.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/52.jpg" id="id-446057687101717691"><img alt="By the Ears" src="images/52-tb.jpg" title="By The Ears" id="id-8044292831314477797"></a></p>
<p><br>When old Mr. Bunny had driven the cat into the greenhouse, he locked the
door.</p>
<p>Then he came back to the basket and took out his son Benjamin by the ears,
and whipped him with the little switch.</p>
<p>Then he took out his nephew Peter.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/55.jpg" id="id-3670229911124339158"><img alt="Marching" src="images/55-tb.jpg" title="Marching" id="id-6573408550063433630"></a></p>
<p><br>Then he took out the handkerchief of onions, and marched out of the
garden.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/57.jpg" id="id-5075637184072166693"><img alt="In the Garden" src="images/57-tb.jpg" title="In the Garden" id="id-5118818320055138898"></a></p>
<p><br>When Mr. McGregor returned about half an hour later he observed several
things which perplexed him.</p>
<p>It looked as though some person had been walking all over the garden in a
pair of clogs—only the footmarks were too ridiculously little!</p>
<p>Also he could not understand how the cat could have managed to shut
herself up <i>inside</i> the greenhouse, locking the door upon the <i>outside</i>.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/58.jpg" id="id-5580485707179832753"><img alt="Home Again" src="images/58-tb.jpg" title="Home Again" id="id-7724439079371433503"></a></p>
<p>When Peter got home his mother forgave him, because she was so glad to see
that he had found his shoes and coat. Cotton-tail and Peter folded up the
pocket-handkerchief, and old Mrs. Rabbit strung up the onions and hung
them from the kitchen ceiling, with the bunches of herbs and the
rabbit-tobacco.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

<div class="agate">PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
</div><div>
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div><div>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div><div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div><div>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg™ License.
</div><div>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div><div>

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:
</div><ul>
    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul><div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

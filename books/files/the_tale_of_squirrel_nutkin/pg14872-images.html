<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/8.jpg" id="id-8945162398931900474"><img alt="Nutkin and his tail" src="images/8-tb.jpg" title="Nutkin and his tail" id="id-2435567332020646135"></a></p>
<p>This is a Tale about a tail—a tail that belonged to a little red
squirrel, and his name was Nutkin.</p>
<p>He had a brother called Twinkleberry, and a great many cousins: they lived
in a wood at the edge of a lake.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/11.jpg" id="id-7397058467545780563"><img alt="Old Brown Flying Home" src="images/11-tb.jpg" title="Old Brown Flying Home" id="id-6416426375488654481"></a></p>
<p>In the middle of the lake there is an island covered with trees and nut
bushes; and amongst those trees stands a hollow oak-tree, which is the
house of an owl who is called Old Brown.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/12.jpg" id="id-5520832079100695012"><img alt="At the Edge of the Lake" src="images/12-tb.jpg" title="At the Edge of the Lake" id="id-3834172517158305177"></a></p>
<p>One autumn when the nuts were ripe, and the leaves on the hazel bushes
were golden and green—Nutkin and Twinkleberry and all the other little
squirrels came out of the wood, and down to the edge of the lake.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/15.jpg" id="id-1883187150711477558"><img alt="Rafting to the Island" src="images/15-tb.jpg" title="Rafting to the Island" id="id-3503381404328020612"></a></p>
<p>They made little rafts out of twigs, and they paddled away over the water
to Owl Island to gather nuts.</p>
<p>Each squirrel had a little sack and a large oar, and spread out his tail
for a sail.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/16.jpg" id="id-8892041039530450486"><img alt="The First Offering" src="images/16-tb.jpg" title="The First Offering" id="id-2183032861941752424"></a></p>
<p>They also took with them an offering of three fat mice as a present for
Old Brown, and put them down upon his door-step.</p>
<p>Then Twinkleberry and the other little squirrels each made a low bow, and
said politely—</p>
<p>"Old Mr. Brown, will you favour us with permission to gather nuts upon
your island?"</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/19.jpg" id="id-7323933704072513563"><img alt="Nutkin Bobbing Like a Cherry" src="images/19-tb.jpg" title="Nutkin Bobbing Like a Cherry" id="id-2233687628572976929"></a></p>
<p>But Nutkin was excessively impertinent in his manners. He bobbed up and
down like a little red <i>cherry</i>, singing—</p>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Riddle me, riddle me, rot-tot-tote!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">A little wee man, in a red red coat!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">A staff in his hand, and a stone in his throat;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">If you'll tell me this riddle, I'll give you a groat."</span><br>
</p>
<p>Now this riddle is as old as the hills; Mr. Brown paid no attention
whatever to Nutkin.</p>
<p>He shut his eyes obstinately and went to sleep.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/20.jpg" id="id-7894096297446760825"><img alt="Filling the Sacks" src="images/20-tb.jpg" title="Filling the Sacks" id="id-9067748026864624316"></a></p>
<p>The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts, and sailed away home in
the evening.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/23.jpg" id="id-1668235568672489261"><img alt="The Second Offering" src="images/23-tb.jpg" title="The Second Offering" id="id-6584306932607479042"></a></p>
<p>But next morning they all came back again to Owl Island; and Twinkleberry
and the others brought a fine fat mole, and laid it on the stone in front
of Old Brown's doorway, and said—</p>
<p>"Mr. Brown, will you favour us with your gracious permission to gather
some more nuts?"</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/24.jpg" id="id-31113517552211276"><img alt="Tickling with a Nettle" src="images/24-tb.jpg" title="Tickling with a Nettle" id="id-8710733048113917339"></a></p>
<p>But Nutkin, who had no respect, began to dance up and down, tickling old
Mr. Brown with a <i>nettle</i> and singing—</p>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Old Mr. B! Riddle-me-ree!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Hitty Pitty within the wall,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Hitty Pitty without the wall;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">If you touch Hitty Pitty,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Hitty Pitty will bite you!"</span><br>
</p>
<p>Mr. Brown woke up suddenly and carried the mole into his house.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/27.jpg" id="id-135785875022978896"><img alt="Shut the Door in His Face" src="images/27-tb.jpg" title="Shut the Door in His Face" id="id-4950948301542649046"></a></p>
<p>He shut the door in Nutkin's face. Presently a little thread of blue
<i>smoke</i> from a wood fire came up from the top of the tree, and Nutkin
peeped through the key-hole and sang—</p>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"A house full, a hole full!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And you cannot gather a bowl-full!"</span><br>
</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/28.jpg" id="id-2513866154030522100"><img alt="Playing Marbles" src="images/28-tb.jpg" title="Playing Marbles" id="id-6492900170347101078"></a></p>
<p>The squirrels searched for nuts all over the island and filled their
little sacks.</p>
<p>But Nutkin gathered oak-apples—yellow and scarlet—and sat upon a
beech-stump playing marbles, and watching the door of old Mr. Brown.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/31.jpg" id="id-8093281966982745337"><img alt="Fishing for Minnows" src="images/31-tb.jpg" title="Fishing for Minnows" id="id-2807167828427647956"></a></p>
<p>On the third day the squirrels got up very early and went fishing; they
caught seven fat minnows as a present for Old Brown.</p>
<p>They paddled over the lake and landed under a crooked chestnut tree on Owl
Island.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/32.jpg" id="id-301647967897429445"><img alt="Bringing the Third Offering" src="images/32-tb.jpg" title="Bringing the Third Offering" id="id-8377679530267868313"></a></p>
<p>Twinkleberry and six other little squirrels each carried a fat minnow; but
Nutkin, who had no nice manners, brought no present at all. He ran in
front, singing—</p>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"The man in the wilderness said to me,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'How many strawberries grow in the sea?'</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">I answered him as I thought good—</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">'As many red herrings as grow in the wood.'"</span><br>
</p>
<p>But old Mr. Brown took no interest in riddles—not even when the answer
was provided for him.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/35.jpg" id="id-4748579163284620741"><img alt="The Fourth Offering" src="images/35-tb.jpg" title="The Fourth Offering" id="id-5998153949711405823"></a></p>
<p>On the fourth day the squirrels brought a present of six fat beetles,
which were as good as plums in <i>plum-pudding</i> for Old Brown. Each beetle
was wrapped up carefully in a dock-leaf, fastened with a pine-needle pin.</p>
<p>But Nutkin sang as rudely as ever—</p>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">"Old Mr. B! riddle-me-ree</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Flour of England, fruit of Spain,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Met together in a shower of rain;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Put in a bag tied round with a string,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">If you'll tell me this riddle, I'll give you a ring!"</span><br>
</p>
<p>Which was ridiculous of Nutkin, because he had not got any ring to give to
Old Brown.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/36.jpg" id="id-4653602999293511713"><img alt="Playing with Pincushions" src="images/36-tb.jpg" title="Playing with Pincushions" id="id-8404577918366417405"></a></p>
<p>The other squirrels hunted up and down the nut bushes; but Nutkin
gathered robin's pincushions off a briar bush, and stuck them full of
pine-needle pins.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/39.jpg" id="id-6557983188303482060"><img alt="The Fifth Offering" src="images/39-tb.jpg" title="The Fifth Offering" id="id-4652523497356844000"></a></p>
<p>On the fifth day the squirrels brought a present of wild honey; it was so
sweet and sticky that they licked their fingers as they put it down upon
the stone. They had stolen it out of a bumble <i>bees'</i> nest on the tippitty
top of the hill.</p>
<p>But Nutkin skipped up and down, singing—</p>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Hum-a-bum! buzz! buzz! Hum-a-bum buzz!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">As I went over Tipple-tine</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">I met a flock of bonny swine;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Some yellow-nacked, some yellow backed!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">They were the very bonniest swine</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">That e'er went over Tipple-tine."</span><br>
</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/40.jpg" id="id-9082035251491724063"><img alt="Eating the Honey" src="images/40-tb.jpg" title="Eating the Honey" id="id-1325729528726757642"></a></p>
<p>Old Mr. Brown turned up his eyes in disgust at the impertinence of Nutkin.</p>
<p>But he ate up the honey!</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/43.jpg" id="id-1674029435561790728"><img alt="Playing Ninepins" src="images/43-tb.jpg" title="Playing Ninepins" id="id-7097946621188174127"></a></p>
<p>The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts.</p>
<p>But Nutkin sat upon a big flat rock, and played ninepins with a crab apple
and green fir-cones.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/44.jpg" id="id-3618001383040559067"><img alt="The Sixth Offering" src="images/44-tb.jpg" title="The Sixth Offering" id="id-5611154217653302038"></a></p>
<p>On the sixth day, which was Saturday, the squirrels came again for the
last time; they brought a new-laid <i>egg</i> in a little rush basket as a last
parting present for Old Brown.</p>
<p>But Nutkin ran in front laughing, and shouting—</p>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Humpty Dumpty lies in the beck,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">With a white counterpane round his neck,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Forty doctors and forty wrights,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Cannot put Humpty Dumpty to rights!"</span><br>
</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/47.jpg" id="id-3991577992209871845"><img alt="Old Brown's Interest" src="images/47-tb.jpg" title="Old Brown's Interest" id="id-756180856894294481"></a></p>
<p>Now old Mr. Brown took an interest in eggs; he opened one eye and shut it
again. But still he did not speak.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/48.jpg" id="id-2587010910120481569"><img alt="More and More Impertinent" src="images/48-tb.jpg" title="More and More Impertinent" id="id-8816846997413406568"></a></p>
<p>Nutkin became more and more impertinent—</p>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"Old Mr. B! Old Mr. B!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hickamore, Hackamore, on the King's kitchen door;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">All the King's horses, and all the King's men,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Couldn't drive Hickamore, Hackamore,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Off the King's kitchen door."</span><br>
</p>
<p>Nutkin danced up and down like a <i>sunbeam</i>; but still Old Brown said
nothing at all.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/51.jpg" id="id-7316060992769118051"><img alt="Leaping at Old Brown's Head" src="images/51-tb.jpg" title="Leaping at Old Brown's Head" id="id-5711088462926220059"></a></p>
<p>Nutkin began again—</p>

</p>
<p>Nutkin made a whirring noise to sound like the <i>wind</i>, and he took a
running jump right onto the head of Old Brown!...</p>
<p>Then all at once there was a flutterment and a scufflement and a loud
"Squeak!"</p>
<p>The other squirrels scuttered away into the bushes.</p>

<p>When they came back very cautiously, peeping round the tree—there was Old
Brown sitting on his door-step, quite still, with his eyes closed, as if
nothing had happened.</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;">
<p><i>But Nutkin was in his waistcoat pocket!</i></p>

<p>Old Brown carried Nutkin into his house, and held him up by the tail,
intending to skin him; but Nutkin pulled so very hard that his tail broke
in two, and he dashed up the staircase and escaped out of the attic
window.</p>

<p>And to this day, if you meet Nutkin up a tree and ask him a riddle, he
will throw sticks at you, and stamp his feet and scold, and shout—</p>
<p>"Cuck-cuck-cuck-cur-r-r-cuck-k-k!"</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website

Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul><div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

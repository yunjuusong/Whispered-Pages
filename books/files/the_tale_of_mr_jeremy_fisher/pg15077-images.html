</div>
<p>Once upon a time there
was a frog called Mr.
Jeremy Fisher; he lived in a
little damp house amongst the
buttercups at the edge of a
pond.</p>
<p>The water was all slippy-sloppy
in the larder and
in the back passage.</p>
<p>But Mr. Jeremy liked getting
his feet wet; nobody ever
scolded him, and he never
caught a cold!</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="Jeremy" src="images/jf05.jpg" title="Jeremy" id="id-6108970550931905204">
</div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="Jeremy" src="images/jf06.jpg" title="Jeremy" id="id-2146990007962184949">
</div>
<p>He was quite pleased when
he looked out and saw
large drops of rain, splashing
in the pond—</p>
<p>"I will get some worms
and go fishing and catch
a dish of minnows for my
dinner," said Mr. Jeremy
Fisher. "If I catch more than
five fish, I will invite my
friends Mr. Alderman Ptolemy
Tortoise and Sir Isaac Newton.
The Alderman, however, eats
salad."</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="Digging for worms" src="images/jf07.jpg" title="Digging for worms" id="id-8060590478452774912">
</div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="Jeremy" src="images/jf08.jpg" title="Jeremy" id="id-8373089912828794136">
</div>
<p>Mr. Jeremy put on a
macintosh, and a pair
of shiny goloshes; he took his
rod and basket, and set off
with enormous hops to the
place where he kept his boat.</p>
<p>The boat was round and
green, and very like the
other lily-leaves. It was
tied to a water-plant in
the middle of the pond.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="Jeremy" src="images/jf09.jpg" title="Jeremy" id="id-3973664916972875756">
</div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="Jeremy" src="images/jf10.jpg" title="Jeremy" id="id-881865909623427311">
</div>
<p>Mr. Jeremy took a reed
pole, and pushed the
boat out into open water. "I
know a good place for minnows,"
said Mr. Jeremy
Fisher.</p>
<p>Mr. Jeremy stuck his
pole into the mud and
fastened the boat to it.</p>
<p>Then he settled himself
cross-legged and arranged his
fishing tackle. He had the
dearest little red float. His
rod was a tough stalk of
grass, his line was a fine long
white horse-hair, and he tied
a little wriggling worm at the
end.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="Jeremy" src="images/jf11.jpg" title="Jeremy" id="id-6447240082812472858">
</div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="Jeremy" src="images/jf12.jpg" title="Jeremy" id="id-1431592716491300698">
</div>
<p>The rain trickled down his
back, and for nearly an
hour he stared at the float.</p>
<p>"This is getting tiresome,
I think I should like some
lunch," said Mr. Jeremy
Fisher.</p>
<p>He punted back again
amongst the water-plants,
and took some lunch
out of his basket.</p>
<p>"I will eat a butterfly sandwich,
and wait till the
shower is over," said Mr.
Jeremy Fisher.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="Jeremy" src="images/jf13.jpg" title="Jeremy" id="id-6898741675946873896">
</div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="Beetle" src="images/jf14.jpg" title="Beetle" id="id-1765813597118383049">
</div>
<p>A great big water-beetle
came up underneath the
lily leaf and tweaked the toe
of one of his goloshes.</p>
<p>Mr. Jeremy crossed his legs
up shorter, out of reach, and
went on eating his sandwich.</p>
<p>Once or twice something
moved about with a
rustle and a splash amongst
the rushes at the side of the
pond.</p>
<p>"I trust that is not a rat,"
said Mr. Jeremy Fisher; "I
think I had better get away
from here."</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="I trust that is not a rat" src="images/jf15.jpg" title="I trust that is not a rat" id="id-2831255302475418436">
</div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="Jeremy" src="images/jf16.jpg" title="Jeremy" id="id-6594545188563444733">
</div>
<p>Mr. Jeremy shoved the
boat out again a little
way, and dropped in the bait.
There was a bite almost
directly; the float gave a
tremendous bobbit!</p>
<p>"A minnow! a minnow! I
have him by the nose!" cried
Mr. Jeremy Fisher, jerking
up his rod.</p>
<p>But what a horrible surprise!
Instead of a
smooth fat minnow, Mr.
Jeremy landed little Jack
Sharp the stickleback, covered
with spines!</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="Jeremy" src="images/jf17.jpg" title="Jeremy" id="id-167233037867819330">
</div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="Jeremy" src="images/jf18.jpg" title="Jeremy" id="id-142764350738338436">
</div>
<p>The stickleback floundered
about the boat, pricking
and snapping until he was
quite out of breath. Then he
jumped back into the water.</p>
<p>And a shoal of other little
fishes put their heads
out, and laughed at Mr.
Jeremy Fisher.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="Jeremy" src="images/jf19.jpg" title="Jeremy" id="id-3948910176070302235">
</div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="Jeremy" src="images/jf20.jpg" title="Jeremy" id="id-2335696494829524107">
</div>
<p>And while Mr. Jeremy sat
disconsolately on the
edge of his boat—sucking his
sore fingers and peering down
into the water—a <i>much</i> worse
thing happened; a really
<i>frightful</i> thing it would have
been, if Mr. Jeremy had not
been wearing a macintosh!</p>
<p>A great big enormous
trout came up—ker-pflop-p-p-p!
with a splash—and
it seized Mr. Jeremy with
a snap, "Ow! Ow! Ow!"—and
then it turned and dived
down to the bottom of the
pond!</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="Trout" src="images/jf21.jpg" title="Trout" id="id-2244439628469446608">
</div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="Trout" src="images/jf22.jpg" title="Trout" id="id-28143825557320512">
</div>
<p>But the trout was so displeased
with the taste of
the macintosh, that in less
than half a minute it spat him
out again; and the only thing
it swallowed was Mr. Jeremy's
goloshes.</p>
<p>Mr. Jeremy bounced up
to the surface of the
water, like a cork and the
bubbles out of a soda water
bottle; and he swam with
all his might to the edge of
the pond.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="Jeremy" src="images/jf23.jpg" title="Jeremy" id="id-4754818511072222459">
</div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="Jeremy" src="images/jf24.jpg" title="Jeremy" id="id-7416101085326685112">
</div>
<p>He scrambled out on the
first bank he came to,
and he hopped home across
the meadow with his macintosh
all in tatters.</p>
<p>"What a mercy that was
not a pike!" said
Mr. Jeremy Fisher. "I have
lost my rod and basket; but
it does not much matter, for I
am sure I should never have
dared to go fishing again!"</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="Jeremy" src="images/jf25.jpg" title="Jeremy" id="id-8264701652558513264">
</div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="Jeremy and Guests" src="images/jf26.jpg" title="Jeremy and Guests" id="id-2654592878502625353">
</div>
<p>He put some sticking
plaster on his fingers,
and his friends both came to
dinner. He could not offer
them fish, but he had something
else in his larder.</p>
<p>Sir Isaac Newton
wore his black and gold
waistcoat,</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="Jeremy and Newton" src="images/jf27.jpg" title="Jeremy and Newton" id="id-5403361282565803149">
</div>
<p>And Mr. Alderman Ptolemy
Tortoise brought a salad
with him in a string bag.</p>

<p>And instead of a nice dish
of minnows—they had a
roasted grasshopper with
lady-bird sauce; which frogs
consider a beautiful treat; but
<i>I</i> think it must have been
nasty!</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">

state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification

</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

<p>Once upon a time there were four little Rabbits, and their names were—</p>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Flopsy,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Mopsy,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Cotton-tail,</span><br>
and Peter.<br>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<img alt="[Illustration]" height="575" src="images/peter08.jpg" width="487" id="id-7766624359023166763">
</div>
<p>They lived with their Mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a
very big fir-tree.</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<img alt="[Illustration]" height="533" src="images/peter11.jpg" width="469" id="id-6778384787154781427">
</div>
<p>'Now my dears,' said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, 'you may go into
the fields or down the lane, but don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden:
your Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs.
McGregor.'</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<img alt="[Illustration]" height="511" src="images/peter12.jpg" width="469" id="id-770137571241936578">
</div>
<p>'Now run along, and don't get into mischief. I am going out.'</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<img alt="[Illustration]" height="566" src="images/peter15.jpg" width="457" id="id-5145052549037660536">
</div>
<p>Then old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella, and went through
the wood to the baker's. She bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns.</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<img alt="[Illustration]" height="595" src="images/peter16.jpg" width="487" id="id-9201884220914924631">
</div>
<p>Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail, who were good little bunnies, went
down the lane to gather blackberries:</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<img alt="[Illustration]" height="475" src="images/peter19.jpg" width="440" id="id-6654624009220752528">
</div>
<p>But Peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to Mr. McGregor's
garden, and squeezed under the gate!</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<img alt="[Illustration]" height="557" src="images/peter20.jpg" width="476" id="id-2345497695782678451">
</div>
<p>First he ate some lettuces and some French beans; and then he ate
some radishes;</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<img alt="[Illustration]" height="528" src="images/peter23.jpg" width="431" id="id-4586825197162780011">
</div>
<p>And then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley.</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<img alt="[Illustration]" height="384" src="images/peter24.jpg" width="400" id="id-3906865808708105651">
</div>
<p>But round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr. McGregor!</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<img alt="[Illustration]" height="453" src="images/peter27.jpg" width="475" id="id-5274675818165993918">
</div>
<p>Mr. McGregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages,
but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out, 'Stop thief!'</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<img alt="[Illustration]" height="568" src="images/peter28.jpg" width="470" id="id-3589008102383707517">
</div>
<p>Peter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden,
for he had forgotten the way back to the gate.</p>
<p>He lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe
amongst the potatoes.</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<img alt="[Illustration]" height="419" src="images/peter31.jpg" width="426" id="id-5004529412748893830">
</div>
<p>After losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that I
think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately
run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his
jacket. It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<img alt="[Illustration]" height="512" src="images/peter32.jpg" width="437" id="id-4315639044517751369">
</div>
<p>Peter gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were
overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great
excitement, and implored him to exert himself.</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<img alt="[Illustration]" height="493" src="images/peter35.jpg" width="474" id="id-4608057253081592814">
</div>
<p>Mr. McGregor came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the
top of Peter; but Peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket behind him.</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<img alt="[Illustration]" height="433" src="images/peter36.jpg" width="420" id="id-3082292487070458649">
</div>
<p>And rushed into the tool-shed, and jumped into a can. It would have
been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it.</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<img alt="[Illustration]" height="545" src="images/peter39.jpg" width="416" id="id-6814604962983001766">
</div>
<p>Mr. McGregor was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the tool-shed,
	perhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot. He began to turn them over carefully, looking under each.</p>
<p>Presently Peter sneezed—'Kertyschoo!' Mr. McGregor was after him in no time.</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<img alt="[Illustration]" height="530" src="images/peter40.jpg" width="469" id="id-6207649395613842747">
</div>
<p>And tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of a window,
upsetting three plants. The window was too small for Mr. McGregor, and
he was tired of running after Peter. He went back to his work.</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<img alt="[Illustration]" height="503" src="images/peter43.jpg" width="407" id="id-1311117966589562721">
</div>
<p>Peter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with
fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go. Also he was
very damp with sitting in that can.</p>
<p>After a time he began to wander about, going lippity—lippity—not
very fast, and looking all round.</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<img alt="[Illustration]" height="537" src="images/peter44.jpg" width="409" id="id-2849263497714212385">
</div>
<p>He found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room
for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.</p>
<p>An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying
peas and beans to her family in the wood. Peter asked her the way to
the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not
answer. She only shook her head at him. Peter began to cry.</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<img alt="[Illustration]" height="554" src="images/peter47.jpg" width="461" id="id-8434452172816831025">
</div>
<p>Then he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he
became more and more puzzled. Presently, he came to a pond where Mr.
McGregor filled his water-cans. A white cat was staring at some
gold-fish, she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her
tail twitched as if it were alive. Peter thought it best to go away
without speaking to her; he had heard about cats from his cousin,
little Benjamin Bunny.</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<img alt="[Illustration]" height="556" src="images/peter48.jpg" width="451" id="id-6104092429331217619">
</div>
<p>He went back towards the tool-shed, but suddenly, quite close to him,
he heard the noise of a hoe—scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch.
Peter scuttered underneath the bushes. But presently, as nothing
happened, he came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow and peeped over.
The first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing onions. His back was
turned towards Peter, and beyond him was the gate!</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<img alt="[Illustration]" height="533" src="images/peter51.jpg" width="449" id="id-5765757071549350779">
</div>
<p>Peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow; and started running
as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some black-currant bushes.</p>
<p>Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but Peter did not care.
He slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden.</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<img alt="[Illustration]" height="530" src="images/peter52.jpg" width="408" id="id-4710220657347962507">
</div>
<p>Mr. McGregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scare-crow
to frighten the blackbirds.</p>
<p>Peter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir-tree.</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<img alt="[Illustration]" height="510" src="images/peter55.jpg" width="440" id="id-4271362468392834746">
</div>
<p>He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the
floor of the rabbit-hole and shut his eyes. His mother was busy
cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes. It was the
second little jacket and pair of shoes that Peter had lost in a fortnight!</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<img alt="[Illustration]" height="505" src="images/peter57.jpg" width="446" id="id-6066857403905792583">
</div>
<p>I am sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening.</p>
<p>His mother put him to bed, and made some camomile tea; and she gave a
dose of it to Peter!</p>
<p>'One table-spoonful to be taken at bed-time.'</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<img alt="[Illustration]" height="535" src="images/peter58.jpg" width="469" id="id-4992393333518211412">
</div>
<p>But Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail had bread and milk and
blackberries for supper.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">

</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

THE REAL LITTLE LUCIE<br>
<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">OF NEWLANDS</span>
</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/8.jpg" id="id-8814795175439536956"><img alt="Lucie and tabby" src="images/8-tb.jpg" title="Lucy and tabby" id="id-6725947843692903341"></a></p>
<p>Once upon a time there was a little girl called Lucie, who lived at a farm
called Little-town. She was a good little girl—only she was always losing
her pocket-handkerchiefs!</p>
<p>One day little Lucie came into the farm-yard crying—oh, she did cry so!
"I've lost my pocket-handkin! Three handkins and a pinny! Have <i>you</i> seen
them, Tabby Kitten?"</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/11.jpg" id="id-5739870933410060819"><img alt="Lucie and the hen" src="images/11-tb.jpg" title="Lucie and the hen" id="id-4239925039438713551"></a></p>
<p>The Kitten went on washing her white paws; so Lucie asked a speckled hen—</p>
<p>"Sally Henny-penny, have <i>you</i> found three pocket-handkins?"</p>
<p>But the speckled hen ran into a barn, clucking—</p>
<p>"I go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!"</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/12.jpg" id="id-3371609850008423693"><img alt="Lucie and the stile" src="images/12-tb.jpg" title="Lucie and the stile" id="id-2204784492704115067"></a></p>
<p>And then Lucie asked Cock Robin sitting on a twig.</p>
<p>Cock Robin looked sideways at Lucie with his bright black eye, and he flew
over a stile and away.</p>
<p>Lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind
Little-town—a hill that goes up—up—into the clouds as though it had no
top!</p>
<p>And a great way up the hill-side she thought she saw some white things
spread upon the grass.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/15.jpg" id="id-506521847296116883"><img alt="Running along the pathway" src="images/15-tb.jpg" title="Running along the pathway" id="id-8612348912336739109"></a></p>
<p>Lucie scrambled up the hill as fast as her stout legs would carry her; she
ran along a steep path-way—up and up—until Little-town was right away
down below—she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/16.jpg" id="id-1144038888089861671"><img alt="waterfall" src="images/16-tb.jpg" title="waterfall" id="id-4983695065975310362"></a></p>
<p>Presently she came to a spring, bubbling out from the hill-side.</p>
<p>Some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water—but the
water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an egg-cup!
And where the sand upon the path was wet—there were foot-marks of a
<i>very</i> small person.</p>
<p>Lucie ran on, and on.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/19.jpg" id="id-8625982724829944658"><img alt="The path ends" src="images/19-tb.jpg" title="The path ends" id="id-7672742748999526211"></a></p>
<p>The path ended under a big rock. The grass was short and green, and there
were clothes—props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited rushes,
and a heap of tiny clothes pins—but no pocket-handkerchiefs!</p>
<p>But there was something else—a door! straight into the hill; and inside
it some one was singing—</p>
<div class="center">
<table style="border-spacing: 0px;padding: 0px;border-width: 0px;" data-summary="Washing song">
<tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left;">"Lily-white and clean, oh!</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: left;"><span style="margin-left: .5em;">With little frills between, oh!</span></td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: left;"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Smooth and hot—red rusty spot</span></td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: left;"><span style="margin-left: .5em;">Never here be seen, oh!"</span></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/20.jpg" id="id-5993001959908602516"><img alt="Through the door" src="images/20-tb.jpg" title="Through the door" id="id-5145509756850456822"></a></p>
<p>Lucie, knocked—once—twice, and interrupted the song. A little frightened
voice called out "Who's that?"</p>
<p>Lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the hill?—a
nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams—just like any
other farm kitchen. Only the ceiling was so low that Lucie's head nearly
touched it; and the pots and pans were small, and so was everything
there.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/23.jpg" id="id-8589453136610558965"><img alt="Into the kitchen" src="images/23-tb.jpg" title="Into the kitchen" id="id-8691038801550627634"></a></p>
<p>There was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her
hand stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at Lucie.</p>
<p>Her print gown was tucked up, and she was wearing a large apron over her
striped petticoat. Her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle,
and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap—where Lucie
had yellow curls—that little person had PRICKLES!</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/24.jpg" id="id-3623484541491075856"><img alt="Meeting Mrs. Tiggy-winkle" src="images/24-tb.jpg" title="Meeting Mrs. Tiggy-winkle" id="id-8278728704954468265"></a></p>
<p>"Who are you?" said Lucie. "Have you seen my pocket-handkins?"</p>
<p>The little person made a bob-curtsey—"Oh, yes, if you please'm; my name
is Mrs. Tiggy-winkle; oh, yes if you please'm, I'm an excellent
clear-starcher!" And she took something out of a clothes-basket, and
spread it on the ironing-blanket.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/27.jpg" id="id-3339532668861944820"><img alt="Ironing the waist-coat" src="images/27-tb.jpg" title="Ironing the waist-coat" id="id-8198957782021131675"></a></p>
<p>"What's that thing?" said Lucie—"that's not my pocket-handkin?"</p>
<p>"Oh no, if you please'm; that's a little scarlet waist-coat belonging to
Cock Robin!"</p>
<p>And she ironed it and folded it, and put it on one side.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/28.jpg" id="id-7068350652203619123"><img alt="The stained table-cloth" src="images/28-tb.jpg" title="The stained table-cloth" id="id-5023364057678236477"></a></p>
<p>Then she took something else off a clothes-horse—</p>
<p>"That isn't my pinny?" said Lucie.</p>
<p>"Oh no, if you please'm; that's a damask table-cloth belonging to Jenny
Wren; look how it's stained with currant wine! It's very bad to wash!"
said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/31.jpg" id="id-6784675123180410650"><img alt="Fetching an iron" src="images/31-tb.jpg" title="Fetching an iron" id="id-735688956444586625"></a></p>
<p>Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went
twinkle, twinkle; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/32.jpg" id="id-652944039953644201"><img alt="Admiring the pinny" src="images/32-tb.jpg" title="Admiring the pinny" id="id-484942877957006837"></a></p>
<p>"There's one of my pocket-handkins!" cried Lucie—"and there's my pinny!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Tiggy-winkle ironed it, and goffered it, and shook out the frills.</p>
<p>"Oh that <i>is</i> lovely!" said Lucie.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/35.jpg" id="id-9211260616590292142"><img alt="Hen stockings" src="images/35-tb.jpg" title="Hen stockings" id="id-8592267278361817753"></a></p>
<p>"And what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves?"</p>
<p>"Oh, that's a pair of stockings belonging to Sally Henny-penny—look how
she's worn the heels out with scratching in the yard! She'll very soon go
barefoot!" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/36.jpg" id="id-6144436028007237056"><img alt="A red handkersniff" src="images/36-tb.jpg" title="A red handersniff" id="id-3134231776826163373"></a></p>
<p>"Why, there's another handkersniff—but it isn't mine; it's red?"</p>
<p>"Oh no, if you please'm; that one belongs to old Mrs. Rabbit; and it <i>did</i>
so smell of onions! I've had to wash it separately, I can't get out the
smell."</p>
<p>"There's another one of mine," said Lucie.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/39.jpg" id="id-3801596482638466584"><img alt="Kitten mittens" src="images/39-tb.jpg" title="Kitten mittens" id="id-4030788402848020681"></a></p>
<p>"What are those funny little white things?"</p>
<p>"That's a pair of mittens belonging to Tabby Kitten; I only have to iron
them; she washes them herself."</p>
<p>"There's my last pocket-handkin!" said Lucie.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/40.jpg" id="id-5379570768320238345"><img alt="Starching" src="images/40-tb.jpg" title="Starching" id="id-1443927031954139374"></a></p>
<p>"And what are you dipping into the basin of starch?"</p>
<p>"They're little dicky shirt-fronts belonging to Tom Titmouse—most
terrible particular!" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle. "Now I've finished my
ironing; I'm going to air some clothes."</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/43.jpg" id="id-6784408842713417799"><img alt="Woolly coats" src="images/43-tb.jpg" title="Woolly coats" id="id-3167373325922657830"></a></p>
<p>"What are these dear soft fluffy things?" said Lucie.</p>
<p>"Oh those are woolly coats belonging to the little lambs at Skelghyl."</p>
<p>"Will their jackets take off?" asked Lucie.</p>
<p>"Oh yes, if you please'm; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder. And
here's one marked for Gatesgarth, and three that come from Little-town.
They're <i>always</i> marked at washing!" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/44.jpg" id="id-4038520202622623923"><img alt="Little blue jacket" src="images/44-tb.jpg" title="Little blue jacket" id="id-2078370667235512673"></a></p>
<p>And she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes—small brown coats of mice;
and one velvety black moleskin waist-coat; and a red tailcoat with no tail
belonging to Squirrel Nutkin; and a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging
to Peter Rabbit; and a petticoat, not marked, that had gone lost in the
washing—and at last the basket was empty!</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/47.jpg" id="id-3903300854383219719"><img alt="Time for tea" src="images/47-tb.jpg" title="Time for tea" id="id-6914189107897263478"></a></p>
<p>"Then Mrs. Tiggy-winkle made tea—a cup for herself and a cup for Lucie.
They sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another.
Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's hand, holding the tea-cup, was very very brown, and
very very wrinkly with the soap-suds; and all through her gown and her
cap, there were <i>hair-pins</i> sticking wrong end out; so that Lucie didn't
like to sit too near her.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/48.jpg" id="id-1709531370091171203"><img alt="Hiding the key" src="images/48-tb.jpg" title="Hiding the key" id="id-9188585543831116349"></a></p>
<p>When they had finished tea, they tied up the clothes in bundles; and
Lucie's pocket-handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny, and
fastened with a silver safety-pin.</p>
<p>And then they made up the fire with turf, and came out and locked the
door, and hid the key under the door-sill.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/51.jpg" id="id-8876810893273522033"><img alt="Delivering bunny clothes" src="images/51-tb.jpg" title="Delivering bunny clothes" id="id-5616324912645820806"></a></p>
<p>Then away down the hill trotted Lucie and Mrs. Tiggy-winkle with the
bundles of clothes!</p>
<p>All the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet
them; the very first that they met were Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny!</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/52.jpg" id="id-299691166111271383"><img alt="Very obliged to Mrs. Tiggy-winkle" src="images/52-tb.jpg" title="Very obliged to Mrs. Tiggy-winkle" id="id-3455338250392919506"></a></p>
<p>And she gave them their nice clean clothes; and all the little animals and
birds were so very much obliged to dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/55.jpg" id="id-3111611819917149910"><img alt="Only Lucie's bundle left" src="images/55-tb.jpg" title="Only Lucie's bundle left" id="id-2222208197026724306"></a></p>
<p>So that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile, there was
nothing left to carry except Lucie's one little bundle.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/57.jpg" id="id-2825414798620360411"><img alt="Back over the stile" src="images/57-tb.jpg" title="Back over the stile" id="id-1931238457012766887"></a></p>
<p>Lucie scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand; and then she
turned to say "Good-night," and to thank the washer-woman—But what a
<i>very</i> odd thing! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle had not waited either for thanks or
for the washing bill!</p>
<p>She was running running running up the hill—and where was her white
frilled cap? and her shawl? and her gown—and her petticoat?</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/58.jpg" id="id-5608600914608952629"><img alt="Is that Mrs. Tiggy-winkle?" src="images/58-tb.jpg" title="Is that Mrs. Tiggy-winkle?" id="id-3962629481444431368"></a></p>
<p>And <i>how</i> small she had grown—and <i>how</i> brown—and covered with PRICKLES!</p>
<p>Why! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle was nothing but a HEDGEHOG.</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;">
<div class="blockquot"><p>(Now some people say that little Lucie had been asleep upon the
    stile—but then how could she have found three clean
    pocket-handkins and a pinny, pinned with a silver safety-pin?</p>
<p>    And besides—<i>I</i> have seen that door into the back of the hill
    called Cat Bells—and besides <i>I</i> am very well acquainted with
    dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle!)</p></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online

    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has

        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
